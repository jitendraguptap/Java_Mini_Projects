Abstract:
library management system would be to create a separate class for handling the catalog of books, and another class for handling the individual books. 
This would allow for better organization and separation of concerns, as well as making the code more reusable. The Library class holds a list of all 
the books in the library and has methods for adding and removing books, as well as displaying all the books in the library. The LibraryManagementSyste
m class handles the user interface and communication between the Book and Library classes, using a Scanner object to get user input and controlling 
the overall flow of the program

Introduction:
Library Management System, this project build on Java is a great way to update the record, monitor and add books, search for the required ones, 
taking care of the issue date and return date. It comes with basic features like creating a new record and updating and deleting it. 
 
Explanation:
A Library Management System is a software application that helps to manage and organize the daily operations of a library. 

Before we begin, letâ€™s first define the main components of our LMS. We will need to create a Book class that will hold information about each book in 
the library, including the title, author, ISBN, and availability status.  Finally, you will create a LibraryManagementSystem class that will handle 
the user interface and communication between the Book and Library classes.

Book class will have four instance variables: Title, Author, ISBN, and Availability. These variables will hold the respective information about each 
book. We will also include a constructor that will take in the values for each variable and set them to the corresponding instance variables.Next, we
 will create the Library class. This class will have an instance variable called book that will hold a list of all the books in the library.  We will 
 also include methods for adding and removing books from the list, as well as a method for displaying all the books in the library.Finally, we will 
 create the LibraryManagementSystem class that will handle the user interface and communication between the Book and Library classes. This class will 
 use a Scanner object to get user input and will include a main method that will handle the overall flow of the program.
