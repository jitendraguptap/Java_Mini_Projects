Introduction :
Welcome to Employee Management System! It is a simple management tool using java that helps to add employees, view employee details, and remove 
employees from the system. The system is very handy and works on the admin panel. It is made using java which ensures security at a higher rate. 
In this new world where all new technologies are overtaking old ones, Java is still surviving and competing with all of them single-handedly. 
It is one of the most powerful languages,s, especially from a security point of view. Coming back to our employee management system, it is quite easy
 to use where the admin can add employees on his/her requirements and can view details of employees, and remove employees from the record. The whole 
 process is too easy for the admin which makes this system flexible.

Explanation :
Employee Management System is fully made using the core concepts of java language. It is a system that gives us choices such as – Add Employee, 
Remove Employee, Display Employees and Exit. We need to import two inbuilt classes where first is Scanner which is used to take input from the user 
through the keyboard and the second is ArrayList which is part of the collection framework. ArrayList has ready-made methods like add and remove 
which reduces the extra code for our program. Three classes have been made here – 1. Employee 2. EmployeeManagementSystem 3. employeeManagment. 
Employee class is holding all the necessary getter-setter methods to get and set the employee details like his/her id, age, salary, etc. We have 
overridden the toString() method in the Employee class to display all the details of the employee in a proper format. In EmployeeManagementSystem 
class firstly, we have made one object of ArrayList which is further used for adding, displaying, and removing employees. For adding the employee 
‘add’ method, removing the employee ‘remove’ method is used with the object of the class. ‘Add’ and ‘Remove’ are the inbuilt methods of ArrayList. 
For displaying employees, each loop is used which is displaying details of all the employees present in the record. employee management class consists
 of the main method and switch case where we are calling the respective methods to operate the specific function. For adding an employee, details have
been taken and it has been passed to the object of the Employee class. After that simply with the object of EmployeeManagementSystem, we have called 
the add method. Similarly, the process for removing employees from the system has taken place, the only difference is that process of removal is ID 
specific. Displaying details of employees is a very easy task, just by calling method displays employee’s details. The last option is for exiting the 
program which is simply taking place by breaking the loop. Classes, Objects, and ArrayList is the soul of this system. It is quite easy to code and 
understand this system with having some basic knowledge of OOPS.
